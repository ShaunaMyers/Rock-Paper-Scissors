### View the App in your Browser
[Play Rock, Paper, Scissors here on the live site! (link to be added when GH pages are deployed)](https://github.com/ShaunaMyers/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

### Main View

When opening the app, you will be taken to the main view. On this page, you will see two buttons in the center of the page. You can click the "Classic" button or the "Difficult" button. These buttons also display the rules, explaining which fighter will when in battle. Once you click one of these options, you will be taken to the next screen to select your fighter.
### Select Fighter View

This page displays a selection of fighters that you will be able to choose from, by clicking on the fighter itself. If you chose the "Classic" option on the previous screen then you can choose from three of your lovable fighters: rock, paper, or scissors. If you chose the "Difficult" option on the last screen then you will have five options: rock, paper, scissors, potted plant, and llama.
### Battle Mode View

Once you have selected a fighter by clicking on it, you will be taken to the battle mode view. Here you will see the fighter you chose appear on the left side of the center screen. The fighter the computer chose will appear on the right side of the center screen.

The winner is announced above the fighters and an image of either a computer or a human will be displayed above the winner banner. The scores on either side of the screen will collect the wins and will immediatley reflect the new winnner's score in the battle mode view. In the case of a draw, you will see the matching fighters displayed, both the images of computer and human, and scores will not increase.

You may choose to change the game by pressing the "Change Game" button, at the top right. This will take you back to the main page, where you can select from the "Classic" and "Difficult" variations.

You may choose to reset the score (after the game has commenced and scores have been tallied)...highly recommended for those games where the cheating computer is winning way too often!
