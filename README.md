When opening the app, you will be taken to the home view. On this page, you will see a randomly generated cover with a random title and tagline. You can click the "Show New Random Cover" button to generate a new random cover. If a particular cover strikes your fancy, click the "Save Cover" button to save it in the Saved Covers section. You can click the "View Saved Covers" button to see all of your currently saved covers.  
*Note: The "Save Cover" button will not save the cover to your machine. We recommend taking a screenshot to save your favorite covers to your computer!*
### Select Fighter View

This page displays all of the covers that you have saved. If you would like to delete a cover, double-click on it. (Be careful, though, this is **permanent**!)  
Feeling creative? Click on the "Make Your Own Cover" button!

After all forms are filled, click the "Make My Book" button to view your new creation.
